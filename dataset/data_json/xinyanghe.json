            "description": "Designed and developed a cloud-based server-less web application providing Json schema observations in time series by Java 8 and TypeScript.\n- Implemented a Json schema watch service using AWS ECS to save observations such as frequency of Json field type, statistics including min, max, average in AWS Timestream database.\n- Built a Java library to integrate data stream handler with Json schema watch service and process data by converting raw data notification from AWS SQS to schema observations in cache.\n- Developed a front-end webpage to display schema observations in time series charts by React.\n\nImpact: It helps Alexa scientists to create downstream transformation processes to gracefully handle the data field structure. Data consumer could have access to the evolution of their data\u2019s schema over time. It allows customers to root cause issues without having to manually search logs and pull individual data objects out of Datamart just to figure out what happened to a certain field.\n\u2026\nsee more"

And stored them in AWS DynamoDB. Reduced query cost by building two databases to save log batch and log instance respectively.\n- Integrated querying through AWS Lambda API and rendering the results on webpage.\n\nBuilt schema of services using AWS Cloudformation including log system, AWS Dashboard and Warning service, cross-account IAM role config, S3 Storage buckets and pipelines.\n\nSolved the interface flickering problem in some events of the microscope C# GUI, by freezing the window and unfreezing asynchronously.\n\u2026\nsee more"
