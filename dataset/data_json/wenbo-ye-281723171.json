It greatly improved first reading efficiency by 10% and repeated reading efficiency by over 50%."

            "description": "- Developed RESTful API for error destination to store missed messages and retry to route based on Springboot, MyBatis, MySQL, Redis and Thread Pool, which reduced missed messages from 3000 to 100 each hour.\n- Increased the branch coverage of Unit Tests and Logic Integration Tests by Junit and Mockito from 25% to 75%, which checked the validity of the business code and revised logical errors.\n- Fixed logical bugs like accidental Kafka certificate deletion and added quota limitation for billing statistics, which decreased server crash time from 1 hour a week to 30 minutes.\n- Routed and dispatched messages in coordinator module via Consistent Hash and upgraded gRPC with protobuf from one-way blocking to bidirectional streaming. This increased message routing speed from 700 mps to 1000 mps and significantly optimized system throughput over 40%.\n- Configured monitoring in IoT Core Platform based on Prometheus and set alarm strategies by RegEx. Processed log priority based on log4j2 which made it easier to filter useful error logs\n\u2026\nsee more"
